# Feature Breakdown

### üìò 1. API Documentation
The backend APIs follow the **OpenAPI standard**, ensuring consistent and developer-friendly documentation.  
With **Django REST Framework**, all essential CRUD operations for users and properties are exposed through RESTful endpoints.  
Additionally, **GraphQL** is implemented to allow flexible and efficient querying of nested and specific data requirements.

---

### üîê 2. User Authentication
Authentication is handled through endpoints like `/users/` and `/users/{user_id}/`, enabling user registration, login, and profile management.  
This ensures that only authorized users can perform sensitive actions like creating bookings or managing properties.

---

### üè† 3. Property Management
Property-related operations are managed via endpoints such as `/properties/` and `/properties/{property_id}/`.  
Users can create, update, retrieve, and delete listings, enabling hosts to maintain accurate and up-to-date property details.

---

### üìÖ 4. Booking System
Bookings are processed through `/bookings/` and `/bookings/{booking_id}/`, allowing users to reserve properties and manage trip details.  
This system supports check-in/check-out information and ensures accurate availability tracking.

---

### üí≥ 5. Payment Processing
Handled through the `/payments/` endpoint, this feature manages payment transactions tied to bookings.  
It supports secure and reliable processing to ensure a seamless experience for users and hosts.

---

### ‚≠ê 6. Review System
The review system allows users to leave feedback on properties through `/reviews/` and `/reviews/{review_id}/`.  
Reviews contribute to trust and transparency by allowing users to share their experiences with future guests.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 7. Database Optimizations
To enhance performance, indexing is used to speed up frequent queries, and caching mechanisms reduce database load.  
These optimizations ensure the application scales effectively under high user demand.
