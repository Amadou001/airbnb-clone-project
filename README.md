# Feature Breakdown

### 📘 1. API Documentation
The backend APIs follow the **OpenAPI standard**, ensuring consistent and developer-friendly documentation.  
With **Django REST Framework**, all essential CRUD operations for users and properties are exposed through RESTful endpoints.  
Additionally, **GraphQL** is implemented to allow flexible and efficient querying of nested and specific data requirements.

---

### 🔐 2. User Authentication
Authentication is handled through endpoints like `/users/` and `/users/{user_id}/`, enabling user registration, login, and profile management.  
This ensures that only authorized users can perform sensitive actions like creating bookings or managing properties.

---

### 🏠 3. Property Management
Property-related operations are managed via endpoints such as `/properties/` and `/properties/{property_id}/`.  
Users can create, update, retrieve, and delete listings, enabling hosts to maintain accurate and up-to-date property details.

---

### 📅 4. Booking System
Bookings are processed through `/bookings/` and `/bookings/{booking_id}/`, allowing users to reserve properties and manage trip details.  
This system supports check-in/check-out information and ensures accurate availability tracking.

---

### 💳 5. Payment Processing
Handled through the `/payments/` endpoint, this feature manages payment transactions tied to bookings.  
It supports secure and reliable processing to ensure a seamless experience for users and hosts.

---

### ⭐ 6. Review System
The review system allows users to leave feedback on properties through `/reviews/` and `/reviews/{review_id}/`.  
Reviews contribute to trust and transparency by allowing users to share their experiences with future guests.

---

### ⚙️ 7. Database Optimizations
To enhance performance, indexing is used to speed up frequent queries, and caching mechanisms reduce database load.  
These optimizations ensure the application scales effectively under high user demand.


# API Security

Securing the backend APIs is critical to ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of user data and system resources. The following security measures will be implemented in this project:

### 🔐 1. Authentication
User authentication ensures that only registered users can access protected resources.  
We implement token-based authentication (such as JWT) to verify user identities on every request.  
**Why it matters:** Prevents unauthorized access to personal accounts, booking history, and sensitive actions.

---

### 🛡️ 2. Authorization
Authorization defines what actions a user is allowed to perform after authentication.  
Role-based access control (RBAC) ensures that only the right users (e.g., hosts vs. guests) can access or modify specific resources.  
**Why it matters:** Prevents users from performing restricted operations like modifying others’ property listings or bookings.

---

### 🚫 3. Rate Limiting
Rate limiting is used to restrict the number of API requests a user or IP address can make in a given time period.  
This is crucial for protecting the application from abuse, brute-force attacks, or denial-of-service (DoS) attempts.  
**Why it matters:** Helps maintain API performance and availability for all users.

---

### 🔒 4. Data Encryption
All data transmitted between the client and server will be encrypted using HTTPS (TLS).  
Sensitive fields like passwords and payment info are also securely hashed/stored.  
**Why it matters:** Protects user credentials and payment details from being intercepted during transmission.

---

### 🧪 5. Input Validation & Sanitization
All incoming data will be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).  
**Why it matters:** Ensures data integrity and protects the system from malicious input.

---

Implementing these security practices ensures that users can safely interact with the platform, trust the application with their data, and conduct transactions with confidence.

# CI/CD Pipeline

### 🚀 What is a CI/CD Pipeline?

CI/CD stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment/Delivery**.  
It is a set of practices that automates the process of building, testing, and deploying code whenever changes are made to the project.  
This ensures that new features, bug fixes, and updates can be delivered quickly and reliably.

### 🛠️ Why is CI/CD Important?

- **Consistency:** Every code change is tested and deployed in a repeatable process.
- **Speed:** Reduces manual intervention and speeds up the development cycle.
- **Quality Assurance:** Automated tests catch bugs early before they reach production.
- **Collaboration:** Makes it easier for teams to work together and merge code with confidence.

### 🧰 Tools Used

- **GitHub Actions** – Automates workflows for running tests, linting code, and deploying updates.
- **Docker** – Provides containerization for consistent development and production environments.
- *(Optional additions depending on your stack)*:
  - **Heroku / AWS / Vercel** – For automated deployment.
  - **PostgreSQL / MySQL** – For database integration in test environments.

By using a CI/CD pipeline, this project ensures high code quality, fast iteration, and a smooth deployment process from development to production.
